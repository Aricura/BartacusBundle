Bartacus Documentation
======================

Bartacus aims to integrate parts of the Symfony framework into the TYPO3 CMS
to gain some advantages from Symfony, like Twig rendering and a really good
DI container. Depending on your knowledge and previous experience you will
like it more than Extbase and Fluid. Bartacus uses as base the old plugin
structure for the sake of simplicity.
